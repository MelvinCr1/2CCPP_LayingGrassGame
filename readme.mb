## Introduction

The project is a group effort by Melvin CUREAU and Axel CHEVALLEREAU for the C++ module. It aims to create a console-based version of the "Laying Grass" game, where players compete to create the largest square territory on a grid-based board.


## Game Rules

•	Board Game : The board is a grid of 20x20 squares for 2 to 4 players, and 30x30 squares for 5 to 9 players.
•	Start of the Game : Each player starts with a 1x1 grass tile and a tile exchange coupon. Players place their starting tile on the board, establishing their initial territory.
•	Tiles : There are 96 different tiles, each unique. Each turn, players receive a grass tile. A redemption coupon can be used to choose one tile from the following five. 
•	Tile Placement : The first tile must touch at least one side of the player's starting tile. Subsequent tiles must be placed so as to touch the player's existing territory. Once placed, a tile becomes immutable and cannot overlap other tiles.
•	Territory : The grouping of tiles in contact with the starting tile forms the player's territory. Tiles cannot touch other players' territory.
•	Exchange coupons : An exchange coupon can be used if the tile received is not desired. The player can then choose a tile from the following five.
•	End of Game : The game takes place over nine rounds, with each player playing nine tiles in total. At the end, players can use a trade coupon to obtain an additional 1x1 grass tile, placed freely on the board.
•	Bonus Squares : Certain squares on the board grant special benefits when a tile is placed around them. These benefits include redeeming coupons, laying stone tiles, or even stealing a tile from an opponent.
•	Victory : The player who manages to cover the largest square (for example, 7x7) is declared the winner. In the event of a tie, victory goes to the player with the greatest number of grass squares in their territory.
